## Description

Global Social is a full-stack API social network web application, so users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.

This app uses `Express.js` for routing, `MongoDB` database, and the `Mongoose ODM`.
After creating an API, a tailor-made database was built using Insomnia.
